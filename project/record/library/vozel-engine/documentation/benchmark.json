        #OBSERVATIONS & ANALYSIS
        &data-list
            - CPU time is almost entirely decoupled from face count after switching to indirect rendering.
            - GPU frustum + back-face culling removes ~90% of faces before rasterization stage.
            - Draw call count becomes constant (3) regardless of world size or complexity.
            - Bottleneck shifts from CPU submission to GPU fill rate at extreme view distances.
